# quick-start

Get up and running quickly with a AngularJS application.

## Getting Started

- Clone
- Run `bower install`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gulp`

The application uses browser-sync to start the browser, and monitor for changes.  CSS changes are injected, rather than forcing a reload - sweet.
